Tenant "1" --> "0..*" Environment: contains >
note right on link
    Contains is an existential relationship.
    Deleting the source of the relationship will cause
    all the contained entities to be deleted, too.

    Contains relationships (between any type of entities)
    cannot form loops or diamonds.
end note

Environment "1" --> "0..*" Resource: contains >
note right on link
    Resources can exist at 2 places. Either directly under
    an environment, which is the place where custom
    user-defined resources would live.

    Resources also can live under feeds, where they are
    placed by the feeds when they report what they have
    discovered.
end note

Environment "1" --> "0..*" Metric: contains >
note right on link
    As resource, metrics, too can live under environments
    or feeds.
end note

Tenant "1" --> "0..*" ResourceType: contains >
note right on link
    Resource types live under tenant, so that they can be
    shared across environments and feeds. While feeds
    define the resource (and metric) types they do so on
    a common ground directly under the tenant they report to.

    Note that this is likely to change in the future.
end note

Tenant "1" --> "0..*" MetricType: contains >

Environment "1" --> "0..*" Feed: contains >
note right on link
   Feeds represent "things" that report data and metadata
   Because these things live in the monitored infrastructure, they
   are logically part of the environments that partition that
   infrastructure.
end note

    This relationship is many to many. 1 resource can incorporate
    many metrics and also many resources can incorporate a single
    metric.
end note

ResourceType "0..*" --> "0..*" MetricType: incorporates >
note right on link
    Using this relationship, one can define what metrics
    a resource can contain.
end note

ResourceType "1" --> "0..*" Resource: defines >
note right on link
    Using this relationship one prescribes that a resource has
    given type. Note that this relationship is created
    implicitly.
end note

MetricType "1" --> "0..*" Metric: defines >

Resource "1" --> "0..*" Resource: contains >
note right on link
    Resources create hierarchies. 1 such hierarchy is
    "existential". I.e. deleting a parent resource
    will cause deletion of child resources.
end note

Resource "0..*" --> "0..*" Resource: isParentOf >
note right on link
    In addition to the existential hierarchy modelled using
    the "contains" relationship between resources, resources
    can also form other hierarchies modelled using this
    "isParentOf" relationship.

    "isParentOf" relationship cannot form loops but can form
    diamonds (as opposed to "contains").
