== Introducing Hawkinit
This simple CLI tool written in NodeJS will help you to set up the running instance of http://localhost:8080/hawkular-services/docs/quickstart-guide/[Hawkular Services], multiple instances of Cassandra,
and also the instances of WildFly servers that have the Hawkular agent installed and configured to report the metrics to the Hawkular Services.

User can select if he wants the WildFly server running in the standalone mode or as a managed domain. She can also choose how many instances it should spawn.
If the domain mode is selected, there are some prepared https://github.com/Jiri-Kremser/hawkfly-domain-dockerfiles#scenarios[scenarios] with different profiles and different amount of servers and server groups per host controller.
Instead of standalone mode, one can also spawn domain with multiple host controllers simulating the complex real world scenario in couple of seconds.

Under the hood, the application dynamically creates a `docker-compose.yml` file in the temp directory with the parameters obtained as the answers and run the services
as a linked containers that communicate among themselves. No rocket science, but it can be handy when trying to set up something quickly or when trying the Hawkular ecosystem.

== Usage
The usage is really simple, assuming the `npm`, `docker` and `docker-compose` are installed and the current user belongs to the docker group;
 all is needed is running the `hawkinit` and interactively answer all the questions.

```bash
$ npm install hawkinit -g
$ hawkinit
```

=== Example
Here is an example of spinning up two standalone WF servers reporting to Hawkular Services with one Cassandra node.
