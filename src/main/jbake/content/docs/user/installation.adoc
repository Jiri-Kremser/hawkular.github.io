== Installing the server
Please follow the instruction in the link:quick-start.html[Quick Start document] for the server itself, followed by the Cassandra instructions below.

== Using an external Cassandra Cluster
Beyond basic usage and development, you will likely want to configure Hawkular
to use an external Cassandra cluster.

NOTE: Hawkular requires Cassandra 2.2.x or later. It is recommended to use the
latest 2.2.x release if possible.

Fortunately, this only requires setting
a few system properties.

From the command line::

.Using a cassandra cluster on localhost
[source,shell]
----
bin/standalone.sh -Dhawkular.backend=remote
----

.Using a cassandra cluster on different hosts
[source,shell]
----
expot CASSANDRA_NODES="cassandra_host1,cassandra_host2,..."
bin/standalone.sh -Dhawkular.backend=remote
----

The `CASSANDRA_NODES` environment variable should be a comma-delimited list
of Cassandra node endpoint addresses. The value for each address should match the
value of the `rpc_address` in the cassandra.yaml configuration file. You do not
actually have to specify the address of every Cassandra node. As long as Hawkular
is able to connect to one node, it will discover all of the other cluster nodes.

From standalone.xml::
[source,xml]
----
<system-properties>
  <property name="hawkular-metrics.cassandra-nodes" value="node_1_address,node_2_address,node_n_address"/>
  <property name="hawkular.backend" value="remote"/>
</system-properties>
----

TIP: You can change the keyspace used by setting the `cassandra.keyspace` system property.
