== Getting Started with Hawkular.

.NOTE
Right now there is no Hawkular distribution to download and go. We are working on it.

Once we have a distribution available, you can unzip and start the server

[source,shell]
----
unzip hawkular.zip
cd hawkular
cd wildfly-8.2.0.Final
bin/standalone.sh  # use standalone.bat on Windows
----

You can then navigate your browser to http://localhost:8080/
