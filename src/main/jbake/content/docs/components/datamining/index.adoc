== Introduction
Data Mining currently offers time series prediction engine. This engine can be used for alert prediction or
predictive charts in the UI.

=== Time series models
 - Simple exponential smoothing
 - Double exponential smoothing (Holt's linear trend)
 - Seasonal triple exponential smoothing (Holt Winters)
 - Simple moving average
 - Weighted moving average

All variants of exponential smoothing contains optimizer which finds the best smoothing parameters for given training
data set. Optimizers minimizes mean squared error of one step ahead prediction using non linear optimization
algorithm (Nelder-Mead simplex).

AutomaticForecaster can be used for the best model selecting. It selects the best model based on Akaike information
criterion (AIC and AICc with correction) or Bayesian information criterion (BIC).
If the time series changes during time, AutomaticForecaster is able to select different model from previously selected,
therefore it can be used on arbitrary time series stream data which exhibits concept drift over time.

=== Time series manipulation & Statistics
 - Augmented Dickey-Fuller test
 - Autocorrelation function (ACF)
 - Time series decomposition
 - Time series lagging
 - Time series differencing
 - Automatic period identification based on ACF

== Prerequisites

Hawkular Data Mining Git repository is hosted on link:https://github.com/hawkular/hawkular-datamining.git[GitHub].
To build the repository Maven and Java 8 are needed.

.Data Mining main modules

|Artifact | Description

|hawkular-datamining-forecast | Lightweight library for time series modeling and forecasting.
|hawkular-datamining-rest | Web archive for standalone usage without Hawkular.
|hawkular-datamining-dist | Distribution web archive with hawkular integration code designed to be deployed with Hawkular.

== Data Mining in Hawkular
When Data Mining is deployed in Hawkular, predictions can be enabled by creating relationships:

 - from tenant to tenant for forecasting all metrics of given tenant
 - from tenant to metric type for forecasting all metrics of given type
 - from tenant to metric for forecasting given metric

Following diagram depicts the interaction with other modules. Numbers denotes order of metric data flow from agent to
Data Mining and Metrics module.
