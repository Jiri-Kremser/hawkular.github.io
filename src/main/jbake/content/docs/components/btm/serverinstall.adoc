== Prerequisites

=== Java 8

You need a Java Virtual Machine compatible with Java 8.

== Obtaining the distribution

Check out the https://github.com/hawkular/hawkular-btm/releases[Hawkular BTM releases] page and download the latest
version of the distribution zip file: `hawkular-btm-dist-X.Y.Z.zip`

Unpack the zip file.

== Starting the BTM Server

The distribution contains some environment scripts for configuring the client-side collection mechanism. These scripts by default will report the information to _localhost_ and _port 8180_ (to avoid conflict with other web apps that may be using the default _8080 port_).

Therefore when starting the BTM server we will need to specify a port offset. The command to start the server, from the root folder of the distribution, will be:

[source,shell]
----
bin/standalone.sh -Djboss.socket.binding.port-offset=100
----

NOTE: When the server is initially started, it is preconfigured with a single user *_jdoe_* with password *_password_*. Hawkular Accounts can be used to configure new users.

See link:../../rest/rest-btm.html[Business Transaction Management REST API] for information on available APIs.
