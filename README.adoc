=== Description
When pushing a commit into this branch, the site is automatically built and published to http://hawkular.github.io

=== Building the site on localhost
. `git clone https://github.com/hawkular/hawkular.github.io`
. `git checkout pages`
. Provided Maven is installed, run one of following commands:

* `mvn jbake:generate` Simply runs jbake and generate the site into `target/website` dir.
* `mvn jbake:watch` Polls a folder and run jbake whenever changes happen.
* `mvn jbake:inline` Same as watch, but also launches an embedded winstone container that by default listens on http://localhost:8080
